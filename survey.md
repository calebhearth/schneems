Hello,

Helping people contribute to open source has been my passion for well over a decade. I'm working towards finishing my open source contribution book, but first, I want to hear from you. I have been working on this for years (since before the pandemic even), but I'm finally going to wrap it up. It will be released late in September.


The book will be focused on unblocking contribution barriers and giving contributors actionable skills with loads of real-world examples. It will be downloadable in PDF and EPUB formats (DRM-free, with a Creative Commons license).


This book is a complete brain dump of everything I know about the world of open source contribution. It's what I wish I had when I first started.


Before I finalize everything and send it off to the digital printer, I need to make sure I have covered everything.


That is where you come in. Please take a few minutes to answer this survey below!


Thanks,
