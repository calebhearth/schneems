Hello,

I'm VERY close to finishing my open source contribution manual. I have been working on this for years (since before the pandemic even), but I'm finally going to wrap it up. It will be released early in MONTH.

The book will be focused on unblocking contribution barriers and giving contributors actionable next steps so they never feel stuck.

It will include a PDF and EPUB book (DRM free, with creative commons license). I'm also including three (3) live one-hour sessions for any early birds. In these sessions I'll answer your direct questions about open source. Sessions will be recorded and shared for early purchasers who live in a different timezone.

This book is going to be a complete brain dump of everything that I know about the world of open source contribution. It's what I wish I was given when I first started out.

HOWEVER, I need your help. Before I finalize everything and send it off to the digital printer, I need to make sure I have covered everything.

That is where you come in. Please take a few minutes to answer this super-short survey—there is really only one thing we want to ask you ...

What are your two top questions about contributing to open source that I absolutely NEED to answer?
