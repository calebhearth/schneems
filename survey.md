## Help! I need your questions.

I am close to finishing my book on open source contribution and need your help. I have been working on this for years, and I'm super excited to wrap it up. But first, I want to make absolutely sure that all the big topics are covered. You'll help me and the next generation of contributors by sharing your stories and questions below.

I've put everything I know about the world of open source contribution in this book. It's the book I wish I had when I first started. It focuses on unblocking contribution barriers and giving contributors actionable skills with loads of real-world examples. The format is available as PDF or EPUB (DRM-free, with a Creative Commons license).

The launch is in late September, so I don't have too much time before I need everything finalized. Please help me out by taking a few minutes to answer this survey below. Many, many thanks!
