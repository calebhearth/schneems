# About Me

I believe in good stories and useable technology.

You may have heard of programmers that learned to develop so they could make games. When I was In high school I took a programming class taught by the coach. In the class we made a text based game using basic. Between writing goto statements I wondered how absurdly difficult something like Half Life would be to program, because I was under the false impression that ALL coding was like basic. It was around that time that I decided that I never wanted to write a game and certainly didn't want to be a professional programmer.

Fast forward to me sitting in college, I was studying mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech. Not because I loved cars or anything, but because from a young age I told people I wanted to be "an inventor" when I grew up, and ME was about the most general purpose engineering degree I could find. I had a Co-Op job designing refrigerators for GE. I didn't like that much either.

One day I decided I was going to make a million dollars in my free time by building the next big web app. A roommate of mine was in CS and when I asked what Digg was written in he said "Rails". So I taught myself Rails.

Many years later I would [teach a masters course in programming at the University of Texas and post all my material online](https://www.schneems.com/ut-rails). One consistent question that I get is "how do I learn to program". To this day, my best answer is: find something you want to build instead, build it, and by the end you'll know how to program.

You may have guessed, but I didn't make a million dollars building webapps, but I did find a vibrant programming community in Ruby. I moved to Austin, Texas to work for National Instruments as an "applications engineer". This is a fancy way of saying "phone tech support". I got involved with [Austin on Rails](http://www.austinonrails.org/) and eventually landed a job at [Gowalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowalla).

Gowalla was my second ever programming job interview. The first company I interviewed for asked me to whiteboard (which I didn't know was even a thing) and afterwards I got treated to a heart-to-heart which involved the words "you do not know how to program". Fun times!

I worked at Gowalla until Facebook aqui-hired the design team and I was left sitting on my behind. I ended up getting a remote job working for [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) happily ever after. 5 plus years and going strong.

"So Richard, what would you say you __do__ here".

I maintain the [Heroku Ruby Buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby) which is the thing responsible for making sure `bundle install` on every Ruby app deployed to Heroku works. I also handle support escalations, manage the Ruby documentation, and in general I'm responsible for being an advocate for Ruby customers inside of the company. I get to go speak at conferences, write blog posts, and play around with all sorts of stuff. For the last few years I've been loving performance work.

I love writing. I'm an [O'Reilly Author](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027409.do). I've also written for Ruby Source, CodeShip, Heroku, and of course this blog.

A big part of my life is Open Source. I made a [platform to get people started contributing to Open Source called CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com). I'm in the [top 50 contributors to Rails](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/richard-schneeman/commits) and I maintain 50+ [open source libraries with 530 million + downloads](https://rubygems.org/profiles/schneems). I won a [community award for my involvement in open source back in 2016 called "Ruby Heroes"](https://rubyheroes.com/heroes/2016). Oh also, the Heroku buildpack is open source too.

Recently I've [gone back to school for a Masters degree in Computer Science](https://schneems.com/2017/07/26/omscs-omg-is-an-online-masters-right-for-you/). As a result I've been broadening my languages horizons. Recently I've begun to [write posts about other languages](https://schneems.com/2017/06/14/meditations-on-writing-a-queue/) and [more diverse technical concepts](https://schneems.com/2017/06/12/bayes-is-bae/).

If you're wondering about the "married to Ruby, literally" part on my sidebar - well my wife's name is Ruby. I met her at a Rails meet-up when she was trying to build her first web app. We've got 1 kid and another on the way. Sorry to say but my wife would not let me name my first kid "Sudo".

I tend to write about things that I'm currently working on or learning. Topics vary quite a bit, but just about everything is programmer flavored. Here's a small sample of some posts that I wrote that I enjoy.

- [How I Reduced my DB server load by 80%](https://schneems.com/2017/07/18/how-i-reduced-my-db-server-load-by-80/)
- [Debugging Ruby Cheat Sheet](https://www.schneems.com/2016/01/25/ruby-debugging-magic-cheat-sheet.html)
- [How Ruby Uses Memory](www.schneems.com/2015/05/11/how-ruby-uses-memory.html)
